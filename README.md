### OBS.: `This Program was made using Brazilian Portuguese Language, so maybe there are errors in the console characters!`

### 1. In this repository are available the two versions of the vostoorganizanto project ( the project in code::blocks and the folders with the executable finished ), which is nothing more than a queue organizer, with a graphical interface created from the Windows API.

### 2. This program was developed during the first period of computer science in the discipline of algorithms and programming I, so its concept and operation is basic and simplified. 

### 3. Finally this project was based on the code in c "Initial Concept.c" also present in this directory, the project was discontinued because it was distant / advanced in relation to the discipline, so I could not continue developing it.
